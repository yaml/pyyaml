- &α "A great philosopher once wrote"
- &β "Naughty, naughty, very naughty"
- &γ "Ha ha ha ha ha"
- &😖 "There's a guy in the place who's got a bittersweet face"
- &😃 "And he goes by the name of Ebeneezer Goode"
- "His friends call him 'Ezeer and he is the main geezer"
- "And he'll vibe up the place like no other man could"
- "He's refined, sublime, he makes you feel fine"
- "Though very much maligned and misunderstood"
- "But if you know 'Ezeer he's a real crowd pleaser"
- "He's ever so good, he's Ebeneezer Goode"
- "You can see that he's mischievous, mysterious and devious"
- "When he circulates amongst the people in the place"
- "But once you know he's fun, and something of a genius"
- "He gives a grin that goes around from face to face to face"
- "Backwards and then forwards, forwards and then backwards"
- "'Eezer is the geezer who loves to muscle in"
- "That's about the time the crowd all shout the name of 'Eezer"
- "As he's kotcheled in the corner, laughing by the bass bin"
- &😁 "'Eezer Goode 'Eezer Goode He's Ebeneezer Goode"

- "Ebeneezer Goode, leading light of the scene, know what I mean?"
- "He created the vibe - He takes you for a ride as if by Design"
- "The party ignites like it's comin' alive"
- "He takes you to the top, shakes you all around"
- "Then back down - you know as he gets mellow"
- "Then as smooth as the groove that is making you move"
- "He glides into your mind with a sunny \"Hello!\""
- "A gentleman of leisure he's there for your pleasure"
- "But go easy on old 'Ezeer he's the love you could lose"
- "Extraordinary fellow, like Mr Punchinello"
- "He's the kind of geezer who must never be abused"
- "When you're in town and Ebeneezer is around"
- "You can sense a presence in the sound of the crowd"
- "He gets them all at it, the party starts rocking, the people get excited"
- "It's time to shout loud"
