PyYAML
======

A full-featured YAML processing framework for Python

## Installation

To install, type `python setup.py install`.

By default, the `setup.py` script checks whether LibYAML is installed and if
so, builds and installs LibYAML bindings.
To skip the check and force installation of LibYAML bindings, use the option
`--with-libyaml`: `python setup.py --with-libyaml install`.
To disable the check and skip building and installing LibYAML bindings, use
`--without-libyaml`: `python setup.py --without-libyaml install`.

When LibYAML bindings are installed, you may use fast LibYAML-based parser and
emitter as follows:

    >>> yaml.load(stream, Loader=yaml.CLoader)
    >>> yaml.dump(data, Dumper=yaml.CDumper)

If you don't trust the input YAML stream, you should use:

    >>> yaml.safe_load(stream)

## Testing

PyYAML includes a comprehensive test suite.

To run the complete local test suite, type:

    make test

This creates a local Python environment, runs the pure Python tests, builds a
local copy of LibYAML, and then runs the LibYAML extension tests. The local
LibYAML build is pinned by `LIBYAML-REF`, which defaults to `0.2.5`.

To run only one test mode:

    make test-python
    make test-libyaml

To test with a specific Python version:

    make test PYTHON-VERSION=3.13.5
